[sort::parallel] (https://github.com/fjtapia/sort::parallel) 
=============================================================

*    In this **parallel library**, you can find stable and not stable sort algorithms, in a **single thread and parallel version**, 
     with similar performance than the provided by other libraries as TBB, Cilk, OpenMP or IPP.   
    
*    The intention is to create algorithms **only with the utilities provided by C++11**, without any other library. 
     Any compiler C++11  compliant can compile and run these algorithms.
      
*    These algorithms are **generic**, can sort any kind of object using a comparison object, in contrast with the 
     **specialized** algorithms, as spreadsort, which only sort integers, strings and float values in a single 
     thread version, but with a speed greater than the generic sort algorithms.
     
*    The algorithms are **exception safe**, it means, the exceptions generated by the algorithms guarantee the integrity 
     of the objects to sort, but not they relative order. 
     If the exception is generate inside the objects (in the move or in the copy constructor.. ) the results can be unpredictable.

This library had been create for to be integrated in the [boost](http://www.boost.org) library, inside 
the [boost::sort library] (http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/sort) with the spreadsort algorithms designed and implemented by Steven Ross. 	
It's pending of the final approval, due this can suffer some changes until the final version and definitive approval in the boost library.

Installation
--------------
* This library is include only.	
* Don't need to link with any static or dynamic library.	 
* Don't have  dependence of any other boost libraries or any other external libraries.	 
* For to use, only need a to include the files of the boost/sort/parallel folder, any more.	
* This library had been compiled successfully with the next compilers : GCC 4.7, GCC 4.8, GCC 4.9 , CLANG 3.6, Visual C++ 2013 Update 4, Visual C++ 2015
